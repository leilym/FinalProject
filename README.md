# Some important notes from the guid
## 1.  Converting Stereo Audios to Mono 
## 2.  Noise Reduction/Detection: 
        two tools can be used: 
            1. https://github.com/timsainb/noisereduce
            2. https://scipy.org/install/

## 3. Feature Extraction

# ---------------------
## 4. Speaker Recognition Algorithms:
###     MFCC technique should be applied for feature extraction ( MFCC technique
        should be applied for feature extraction))
